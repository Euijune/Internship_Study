    "Model compression is a technique that shrinks trained neural networks. Compressed models often perform similarly to the original while using a fraction of the computational resources. The bottleneck in many applications, however, turns out to be training the original, large neural network before compression.\n",

    "Model compression reduces redundancy in a trained neural network. This is useful since Transformers barely fits on a GPU (The Large does not). Improved memory and inference speed efficiency can also save costs at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "High parameter counts and a large computational footprint mean production deployment of Transformer and friends remains difficult. Thankfully, the past 3 years have seen the development of a diverse variety of techniques to ease the pain and yield faster prediction times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this notebook focuses on the following suite of methods applied after base model pre-training to reduce the computational cost of prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [**Numeric Precision Reduction**](#section1) : yielding speedups through the use of floating-point reduction and quantization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most general method for yielding prediction-time speedups is numeric precision reduction. In past years poor support for float16 operations on GPU hardware meant that reducing the precision of weights and activations was often counter-productive, but the introduction of the NVIDIA Volta and Turing architectures with Tensor Cores means modern GPUs are now well equipped for efficient float16 arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h3>Mixed Precision Training</h3></font>\n",
    "Floating point types store numeric information of three types – the sign, exponent, and fraction.  Traditional float32 representations have 8 bits and 23 bits respectively to represent the exponent and fraction.  Traditional float16 representations (the format used for NVIDIA hardware) roughly halve both the exponent and fraction components of the representation. TPUs use a variant called bfloat16 that opts to shift some bits from the fraction to the exponent, trading some precision for the ability to represent a broader range of values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Small portions of the network – in particular, portions of the softmax operation – must remain in float32.  This is because the sum of a large number of small values (our logits) can be a source of accumulated error. Because both float16 and float32 values are used, this method is often referred to as \"mixed-precision\".\n",

On earlier architectures (Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal), one may observe a modest speedup. One can run !nvidia-smi to display the GPU’s architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h3>Integer Quantization</h3></font>\n",

    "\n",
    "Truncates floating point numbers to only use a few bits (which causes round-off error). The quantization values can also be learned either during or after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know what range of values a network's activations will likely occupy, you can divide up that range into 256 discrete chunks and assign each to an integer.  As long as you store the the scale factor and the range occupied, you can use the integer approximations for your matrix multiplies and recover a floating point value at the output.\n",

    "Naively, you could select a scale and offset such that no input floating point activation on a set of calibration inputs is mapped to an integer at either extreme of the range of uint8 values (-128, 127).  However, in doing so we sacrifice some precision in order to accommodate extreme values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, frameworks like TensorRT select scale and offset values that minimize the KL divergence between the output activations of the float32 version and int8 version of the model. This allows us to balance the tradeoff between range and precision in a principled way.  As KL divergence can be viewed as a measure of information loss under a different encoding, it's a natural fit.\n",

    "A method first conceived by Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeff Dean in their 2015 work \"Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network\", knowledge distillation involves transferring the knowledge contained within one network (the \"teacher\") to another (the \"student\") via a modified loss.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Observations about knowledge distillation for natural language processing can be summarized as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Knowledge distillation provides efficient and effective lightweight language deep models. The large-capacity teacher model can transfer the rich knowledge from a large number of different kinds of language data to train a small student model, so that the student can quickly complete many language tasks with effective performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The teacher-student knowledge transfer can easily and effectively solve many multilingual tasks, considering that knowledge from multilingual models can be transferred and shared by each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In deep language models, the sequence knowledge can be effectively transferred from large networks into small networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In knowledge distillation, `knowledge types`, `distillation strategies` and the `teacher-student architectures` play the crucial role in the student learning. We will be looking into each of these since each are crucial for getting a better understanding of knowledge distillation landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h3>Knowledge Types</h3></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h4>1. Response-Based Knowledge</h4></font>\n",
    "Response-based knowledge usually refers to the neural response of the last output layer of the teacher model. The main idea is to directly mimic the final prediction of the teacher model. The response-based knowledge distillation is simple yet effective for model compression, and has been widely used in different tasks and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11263-021-01453-z/MediaObjects/11263_2021_1453_Fig4_HTML.png\" height=\"100\" width=\"400\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular response-based knowledge for image classification is known as soft targets by Geoffrey Hinton. As stated in paper soft targets contain the informative dark knowledge from\n",
    "the teacher model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the response-based knowledge usually relies on the output of the last layer, e.g., soft targets, and thus fails to address the intermediate-level supervision from the teacher model, which turns out to be very important for representation learning using very deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h4>2. Feature-Based Knowledge</h4></font>\n",
    "Deep neural networks are good at learning multiple levels of feature representation with increasing\n",
    "abstraction. This is known as representation learning (Bengio et al., 2013). Therefore, both the output of the last layer and the output of intermediate layers, i.e., feature maps, can be used as the knowledge to supervise the training of the student model. \n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, featurebased knowledge from the intermediate layers is a good extension of response-based knowledge, especially for the training of thinner and deeper networks. The various feature types used include Neuron Selectivity Patterns, Attention maps, Sharing parameters, Feature representation, Feature maps, Feature aggregation etc.\n",

    "However, the response-based knowledge usually relies on the output of the last layer, e.g., soft targets, and thus fails to address the intermediate-level supervision from the teacher model, which turns out to be very important for representation learning using very deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h4>3. Relation-Based Knowledge</h4></font>\n",
    "Both response-based and feature-based knowledge use the outputs of specific layers in the teacher model. Relation-based knowledge further explores the relationships between different layers or data samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h3>Distillation Schemes</h3></font>\n",
    "According to whether the teacher model is updated simultaneously with the student model or not, the learning schemes of knowledge distillation can be directly divided into three main categories: offline distillation, online distillation and selfdistillation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h4>1. Offline Distillation</h4></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge is transferred from a pre-trained teacher model into a student model. Therefore, the whole training process has two stages, namely: \n",
    "  1. The large teacher model is first trained on a set of training samples before distillation; and   \n",
    "  2. The teacher model is used to extract the knowledge in the forms of logits or the intermediate features, which are then used to guide the training of the student model during distillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of offline methods is that they are simple and easy to be implemented. However, the complex high-capacity teacher model with huge training time can not be avoided, while the training of the student model in offline distillation is usually efficient under the guidance of the teacher model. Moreover, the capacity gap between large teacher and small student always exists, and student often largely relies on teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h4>2. Online Distillation</h4></font>\n",
    "To overcome the limitation of offline distillation, online distillation is proposed to further improve the performance of the student model, especially when a large-capacity high performance teacher model is not available. In online distillation, both the teacher model and the student model are updated simultaneously, and the whole knowledge distillation framework is end-to-end trainable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In deep mutual learning multiple neural networks work in a collaborative way. Any one network can be the student model and other models can be the teacher during the training process. Co-distillation in parallel trains multiple models with the same architectures and any one model is trained by transferring the knowledge from the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, existing online methods (e.g., mutual learning) usually fails to address the high-capacity teacher in online settings, making it an interesting topic to further explore the relationships between the teacher and student model in online settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#2980B9'><h4>3. Self Distillation</h4></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In self-distillation, the same networks are used for the teacher and the student models and can be regarded as special case of online distillation. There are variants of self-distillation - \n",
    "   1. [Zhang et al. (2019b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08094) proposed a new self-distillation method, in which knowledge from the deeper sections of the network is distilled into its shallow sections.\n",
    "   2. Snapshot distillation ([Yang et al., 2019b](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00123)) is a special variant of self-distillation, in which knowledge in the earlier epochs of the network (teacher) is transferred into its later epochs (student) to support a supervised training process within the same network.\n",
    "   3. ([Yuan et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11723)) proposed teacher-free knowledge distillation methods based on the analysis of label smoothing regularization.\n",
    "   4.  Hahn and Choi proposed a novel self-knowledge distillation method, in which the self-knowledge consists of the predicted probabilities instead of traditional soft probabilities ([Hahn and Choi, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01851)). These predicted probabilities are defined by the feature representations of the training model. They reflect the similarities of data in feature embedding space.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Self-distillation is an powerful and mysterious phenomenon. Here is an excerpt from one of [Microsoft Research Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/three-mysteries-in-deep-learning-ensemble-knowledge-distillation-and-self-distillation/), \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note that knowledge distillation at least intuitively makes sense: the teacher ensemble model has 84.8% test accuracy, so the student individual model can achieve 83.8%. The following phenomenon, called self-distillation (or “Be Your Own Teacher”), is completely astonishing—by performing knowledge distillation against an individual model of the same architecture, test accuracy can also be improved. (See Figure 2 above.) Consider this: if training an individual model only gives 81.5% test accuracy, then how come “training the same model again using itself as the teacher” suddenly boosts the test accuracy consistently to 83.5%?*\n",

    "The importance of attention calculation over the entire sentence has been explored, revealing a large number of redundant computations. One way to resolve this issue is by calculating attention in smaller groups, by either binning them using spatial locality, magnitude-based locality, or an adaptive attention span.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since the outputs are calculated independently, local attention methods also enable a higher degree of parallel processing and individual representations can be saved during inference for multiple uses. Since the multi-head self-attention layer does not contain weights, these methods only improve the runtime memory costs and execution speed, but not the model size.\n",
